# HIV4DATAMX
Addressing the HIV crisis in Mexico using real data to shed light on critical issues, including the over-centralization of resources, which contributes to the increasing number of deaths each year.

## Project Timeline & Status

- **Project Start Date:** September 2024
- **Status:** On-going  
  *Note: Access to government data has proven challenging.*

My problem-solving approach is hypothesis-based (commonly used in consulting). I start by defining a hypothesis that I aim to either prove or disprove, and then I outline the key questions that need to be answered.

# Hypotheses and Key Questions

## Hypothesis 1: Impact of ART and VL Monitoring

Increased access to and proper use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and viral load (VL) monitoring will significantly reduce HIV-related mortality in Mexico.

### Key Questions

- **Epidemiological Trends:**
  - What are the current HIV prevalence and incidence rates across different regions of Mexico?
  - How have HIV-related mortality rates changed over the past decade?

- **Access to Healthcare:**
  - What is the current level of access to ART and VL monitoring in various regions of Mexico?
  - How do healthcare services for HIV patients differ between urban and rural areas, as well as between Mexico City and other regions?

## Hypothesis 2: Expanding Preventive Measures

Expanding access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other preventive interventions will lead to a measurable drop in new HIV infections among high-risk groups.

### Key Questions

- **Preventative Measures:**
  - What is the current level of access to PrEP in Mexico, and how can it be improved?
  - How effective are current HIV prevention campaigns in reaching high-risk populations?

- **Access to Healthcare:**
  - How does the availability of preventive measures affect HIV infection rates across states?

## Hypothesis 3: Influence of Socioeconomic Disparities

Socioeconomic factors—such as income inequality and access to free public health services—are significant predictors of HIV prevalence and treatment outcomes in Mexico.

### Key Questions

- **Socioeconomic Impact:**
  - How do socioeconomic factors influence the spread and treatment of HIV in different demographic groups?
  - How does regional wealth affect access to free public health services?
  - Which regions in Mexico enjoy better access to free public health?

## Hypothesis 4: Benefits of Targeted Public Health Campaigns

Targeted public health campaigns that use population segmentation and risk profiling will be more effective in reducing HIV incidence compared to general campaigns.

### Key Question

- **Target Audience and Risk Profiling:**
  - Which population groups and risk profiles should be targeted?

### Components of Risk Profiling

- **Demographic Factors:**
  - **Age:** Some age groups, like young adults, may be at higher risk due to increased sexual activity or other behaviors.
  - **Gender:** Biological differences and societal roles can influence HIV risk.
  - **Sexual Orientation:** LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly men who have sex with men (MSM), may face higher risks due to specific behaviors and social challenges.

- **Behavioral Factors:**
  - **Sexual Behavior:** Having multiple partners, unprotected sex, or engaging in transactional sex can increase risk.
  - **Substance Use:** Injection drug use and other substance-related behaviors raise the risk of HIV transmission.
  - **Health-Seeking Behavior:** Regular check-ups, use of preventive measures like condoms and PrEP, and adherence to ART are crucial.

- **Socioeconomic Factors:**
  - **Income Level:** Lower income can limit access to healthcare, education, and preventive measures.
  - **Education:** Awareness of HIV prevention and treatment is often linked to educational attainment.
  - **Employment Status:** Unemployment or jobs in high-risk environments can impact HIV risk.

- **Geographical Factors:**
  - **Urban vs. Rural:** HIV prevalence and access to healthcare services can vary significantly between urban and rural areas.
  - **Regional Differences:** Local factors such as healthcare infrastructure and cultural practices can affect HIV rates.

## Statistical Framework for Hypothesis Testing

Each hypothesis will be proven or disproven using the following statistical framework:

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Data cleansing, transformation, and enrichment

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Data understanding and exploratory data analysis

3. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Based on the previous analysis, define sub-hypotheses to test using statistical methods:
     - **Chi-square Test:** For analyzing categorical data
     - **ANOVA:** For comparing more than two groups
     - **T-test:** For comparing the means of two groups
     - **Regression Analysis:** For modeling relationships between variables
     - **Additional Visualizations:** For further insights
